We have constructed a kernel module that blinks an LED attached to the Raspberry Pi for a set amount of time. A sysfs interface will allow user-mode apps to change the period. Although the Raspberry Pi kernel has a GPIO driver that allows user-mode apps to operate the GPIO pins (and LEDs linked to them) directly, we will not utilise it and instead create our own driver to demonstrate direct hardware access.
